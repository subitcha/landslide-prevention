# landslide-prevention
describes a betterment way to prevent occurrence of landsliding with help of  IOT

    Natural hazards like landslides, avalanches, floods and debris flows can result in enormous property damage and human casualties in mountainous regions.Landslide is one of the top most natural disaster happening on hill areas mainly due too heavy rainfall. when soil reaches its highest saturation level the soil becomes loose and results in landslide.

    Our project mainly focuses on the detection of land slide and make prior prevention steps in near places inorder to redue the loss of life and  property.Every project use wireless technology and have a common exosure of soil, in our proposed mode soil type is also taken into account and a survey is measured and stored in server which helps us to analyse and finalise the resultant effect.
   speciality of our project is we use a vibration sensor and a GSM module where the vibration sensor helps in detecting the changes in soil and GSMmodule senda a alert message to higher officials of the area inorder to help them managing the situation.
    
    Raspberry pi3 is used as main board along with a wireless sensor,and a msg alert sstem. this helps us maintain a observation on soil condition and also passes a alert message to areas nearby when there is a caution.
